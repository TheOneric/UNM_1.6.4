# Ultimate Nether Mod (MC 1.6.4; Mod: 1.8.6(probably))
Source code of the last finished and released version of the
[Ultimate Nether Mod](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1285649-1-6-4-forge-the-ultimate-nether-mod-ssp-smp).

If you have some use for this, feel free to go for it,
but this is really not a good learning example. It got
ported over many Minecraft versions and from ModLoader to Forge
and accumulated technical debt over time as well as just
bad design decisions from the start.

If for some reason you decide to port parts of this to a newer version,
re-imagine the concept or similar, feel free to let me know I'd love to see what
this turns into (especially how to reconcile things with Mojang’s own Nether update since)

# History
Unfortunately, this mod was written long ago and I don't have a git history of 
it. I do have some snapshots of earlier release versions, but no full history.

This mod started out with just a few additional crafting recipes for Nether 
resources (before the rename it was known as "More Nether Crafting Recipes", 
which is also why you'll commonly find 'MNC' prefixes in the code.)
Never thought it’d expand this much or receive any attention at all

# Licence
Well, … licencing is a bit tricky since this is a Minecraft Mod
and thus builds upon Mojang's/Microsoft's Minecraft and assets are
also often just a tweaked version of stock Minecraft assets.

As far as this is possible I want to release the source code as LGPLv3 or later.
(with special linking exception for Minecraft)
Original parts of non-code resources are released under CC-BY-SA 3.0 or later,
as far as possible.

This also overrules any stricter licensing conditions I may have used earlier, 
for older builds everyone is as of now free to choose either the original 
licensing conditions or the one laid out here (LGPLv3 and CC-BY-SA).
