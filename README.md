# Ultimate Nether Mod (MC 1.6.4; Mod: 1.8.6(probably))
Source code of the last finished and released version of the
[Ultimate Nether Mod](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1285649-1-6-4-forge-the-ultimate-nether-mod-ssp-smp).

If you want to use the contents of this repository to learn about Minecraft 
Modding, I urge you to reconsider: It is horribly outdated and the code quality 
is … uhh, let's say fitting for a Neher-themed mod.
(Sorry, I wrote this a long time ago and most of it late at night.
Also MC-Mods, which were developed against decompiled and best-effort 
deobfuscated Minecraft source code probably do not make it easy to write clean 
and nice code)
Another warning: Not all of the names and comments are in English and some may 
even be an atrocious mix of langauges mid-sentence. (sorry, grab a dictionary)

If you're looking at this repo because you want to port the mod to a newer 
Minecraft version, you are more than welcome to do so! Please let me know if you 
do so, I'd love to see how this turns out and how this will be integrated with 
the changes made to the Nether in vanilla Minecraft since 1.6.4 (especially 
1.15).
If you need some help with the source code, feel free to ask me!


# History
Unfortunately, this mod was written long ago and I don't have a git history of 
it. I do have some snapshots of erlier release versions, but no full history.

This mod started out with just a few additional crafting recipies for Nether 
resources (before the rename it was known as "More Nether Crafting Recipies", 
which is alos why you'll commonly find 'MNC' prefixes in the code.)
I never thought it would get as big as it did.



# License
Well, … Licensing is a bit tricky since this is a Minecraft Mod and thus builds 
upon Mojang's/Microsoft's Minecraft.
As far as this is possible I want to release the source code as GPLv3 or later.
and non-code resources are released under CC-BY-SA 3.0 or later, as far as possible.


This also overrules any stricter licensing conditions I may have used earlier, 
for older builds everyone is as of now free to choose either the original 
licensing conditions or the one laid out here (GPLv3 and CC-BY-SA).
